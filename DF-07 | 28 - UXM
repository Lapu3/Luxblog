**Cognitive Systems Lab – Denosian Front Simulation Report**
Project Code: DF-07/28-UXM
Classification: Training Exercise / Behavioral Mapping Study 
37°48′N //

*1. Scenario Brief*

The Denosian Front simulation modeled a fragmented continental conflict where three
primary factions — Northern Denos, Southern Denos, and the Coastal League — contested
over diminishing supply chains. The simulation map included dense mountain ranges, arid
desert corridors, and limited maritime chokepoints.

The key operational challenge: sustaining momentum under prolonged attrition while 
defending against logistical bleed through disrupted supply nodes. //

*2. Purpose of Excercise*

This run was conducted to evaluate the integration of cognitive mapping with multi-domain
disruption modeling. 

Primary objectives:
• Identify early indicators of logistical collapse in asymmetric engagements.
• Map behavioral tendencies of faction leadership under sustained pressure.
• Test predictive routing for supply convoys under shifting threat envelopes. //

*3. Initial Hypothesis* 

Prior to the run, analysts predicted:

1. Northern Denos would maintain control of high-ground corridors but gradually lose 
operational tempo due to attrition in fuel and rations.

2. Southern Denos would leverage heavier equipment but remain vulnerable to targeted
supply strikes.

3. Coastal League would overextend maritime assets and face inland penetration from 
multiple fronts. // 

*4. Simulation Design*

• Agent Profiles: Each faction’s leadership and field units were coded with distinct 
behavioral probability curves derived from prior simulated conflicts.
• Event Stream: Over 400 sequential operational events were generated — from ambushes 
to cyber interdictions — each triggering adaptive responses. 
• Cognitive Layer: The sim logged not only moves made, but decision latency and pattern
shifts in leadership styles as conditions worsened.
• Logistics Model: Every movement of supplies was tagged and stress-tested for interdiction, 
rerouting, and black-market leakage. // 

*5. Observations & Outcomes*

1. Behavioral Drift Detected: Leadership in all factions showed measurable drift toward risk-
averse decision-making after 17 days of sustained disruption. 

2. Logistical Collapse Curve: Supply losses exceeding 22% per cycle triggered cascading 
morale drops and unplanned withdrawals in 68% of cases.

3. Adaptive Evasion: Northern Denos successfully trialed deceptive convoy routing, 
achieving a 40% survivability increase over baseline predictions. 

4. Urban Black-Market Nodes: Emerged spontaneously in Coastal League territory, creating 
secondary logistical bleed vectors not present in baseline. // 

*6. After Action Review*

Key lessons from DF-07/28-UXM:
• Early choke-point disruption in mountainous corridors yields disproportionate 
operational collapse.
• Behavioral probability mapping offers predictive lead time on faction-level strategic withdrawals. 
• Hybrid disruption (physical + cognitive) is more effective than pure kinetic or pure informational attacks.

Next phase recommendation: integrate real-time data ingestion from operational theaters to increase predictive accuracy during live deployments. //

*7. Analyst Note* 

Patterns observed in Denosian Front mirror prior cognitive mapping runs against non-
simulated leadership cells exhibiting decentralized command. The emergent interplay
between logistical degradation and decision fatigue remains a primary vulnerability vector.
Further integration with signal artifacts is advised.
